## Detection

### Overview

### 1. Image detection

**Automated Wheat Disease Detection using a ROS-based Autonomous Guided UAV**

- image-based deep learning approach
    - **object detection model**: YOLO V4, EfficientDet, MobileNet V3, VGG 16, Inception, ResNet 50, and
      EfficientNet-B0.
    - **CNN**: weight-sharing ability

- **a custom dataset has been created and labeled**
    - **data augmentation techniques**: increase the number of training data

- efficient mapping and navigation system is presented using a Gazebo simulation
    - **SLAM** (simultaneous localization and mapping):
        - **map**: contains the static obstacles of the robotâ€™s workspace
        - **localization**: enables the robot to map its environment while simultaneously estimating its own position
          regarding this map.
        - **using sensors** (camera, laser range-finder, ultrasonic sensor) to evaluate its distance to the nearby
          obstacles.
        - implemented and tested in a **simulation environment**

- A 2D simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm is used for mapping the workspace autonomously.

- **Summary**: ml for image classification, slam for exploration, A* algorithm for determining move trajectory.



## Navigation

### Overview

### Visual Odometry

**Real-time ROS Implementation of Conventional Feature-based and Deep-learning-based Monocular Visual Odometry for UAV**

- localization is one of the most important tasks for UAVs
    - conventional feature-based methods:**ORB-SLAM3**
        - detection of key features in each image and match them on consecutive images to estimate the camera motions

    - Deep-learning: **SC-SfMLearner** (self-supervised learning)
        - achieve high results on public dataset, but lack of real-time implementation in ROS for navigation system.

- photo-realistic simulator, **Flightmare**, is used to test the implementation
    - fast in collecting and computing a large number of images,
    - but also integrate an accurate UAV dynamic

- Visual Odometry (VO) benchmark dataset:  KITTI, EuRoC, and CityScapes

- **evaluation** process is done by integrating the aforementioned pose estimators into a real-time navigation system,
  benchmarking on streams of photo-realistic synthesized RGB data acquired from Flightmare.
    - the outperforming of the **features-based ORB-SLAM3 over learning-based counterpart**, SC-SfMLearner
    - **learning-based algorithms are vulnerable to failure cases** in which the drone trajectory contains excessive yaw
      rotations.
