These notes were created during my preparation for the [AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam][aws]. 
They help me memorise essential points and knowledge commonly found in frequently asked questions.

The exam requires a substantial amount of knowledge to be memorised, particularly for those new to AWS and cloud computing.

To give you some context, I had some basic experience with AWS services from a unit I took a year ago before I started preparing for the exam. 

To supplement my knowledge, I watched about half of the lectures in this [udemy tutorial][tutorial].

I also completed the first 5 practice exams from [6 Practice Exams][practice] to gain a better understanding of the types of questions that might appear on the actual exam.
I practiced with test questions multiple times and reviewed any questions I answered incorrectly or felt uncertain about.

Luckily, I passed the exam in one shot with a score of 822 out of 1000.

6 Pillars:
1.Operational excellence (Cloudformation): **run** systems to deliver business value.
2.Security (IAM, WAF, KMS): **protect** system while deliver business value
3.Relibility (IAM, Cloudformation, S3): the ability of a system to **recover**
4.Performance efficiency(auto scaling, lambda, elasticache): **use computing resources** efficiently
5.Cost optimisation (budget, cost explorer): run systems at the lowest **price** point
6.Sustainability (auto scaling, fargate, s3, ec2): minimise the **environmental** impacts

recovery time objective: 
 - real-time: Multi-site active/active (run simultaneously)
 - minutes: warm standby (scaled-down but full functional copy)
 - 10s of minutes: pilot light (core component)
 - hours: backup & restore (data only, need redeploy infrastructure)
