I plan to improve my EOI points score for my nominated occupation (233999), which was 90 in the last invitation round (October 2023). To achieve this, I intend to retake the PTE exam and aim for a score of 4 x 79+ in each section. This effort will potentially add 10 points to my score for the next round, though I acknowledge that achieving this target may pose a considerable challenge. Anyway, I'm going to create a study plan for the upcoming days to consolidate my knowledge.
