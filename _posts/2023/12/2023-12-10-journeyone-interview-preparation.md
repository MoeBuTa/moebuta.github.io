Questions:
 - Learning activities for the graduate program, Is it focus on learning tech stacks using some demo projects for 
   training purposes or solving issues in the real-world projects?
 - How is performance evaluated in the graduate developer program, and how the feedbacks be provided?
 - At what stages of the interview process can I get feedbacks if I failed?
   - as I've done several interviews like this, none of them give me a detailed feedback that tells me why I'm failed. I really want to improve myself and get a job soon.
