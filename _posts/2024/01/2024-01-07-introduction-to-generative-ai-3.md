## Generative AI and business

### Task analysis of jobs

**Augmentation vs Automation**

 - Augmentation
   - help humans with a task
     - recommend a response for a customer service agent to edit/approve
 - Automation
   - automatically perform a task
     - automatically transcribe and summarise records of customer interactions

**Evaluating AI potential**

The potential for augmenting/automating a task depends on:
 - technical feasibility (Can AI do it?)
   - can a fresh grad following the instructions in a prompt complete the task?
   - assess if RAG, fine-tuning, or other techniques can help
 - business value (How valuable is it for AI to augment or automate this task?)
   - how much time is spent on this task?
   - does doing this task significantly faster, cheaper or more consistently create substantial value?


### New workflows and new opportunities

### Teams to build generative AI Software

software engineer
 - writing software applications
 - ideally someone who has learned basics of LLMs/prompting
machine learning engineer
 - implementing AI system
 - ideally familiar with LLMs/prompting, RAG, fine-tuning
product manager
 - identifying and scoping the project


## Generative AI and society

### Concerns about AI

1. amplifying humanity's worst impulses
     - fine-tuning, RLHF
2. job loss
     - bring a huge amount of growth and create many new jobs in the process
3. human extinction
     - perfect control not needed to be valuable and safe

### Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

Definition: AI that can do any intellectual task that a human can.

Examples:
 - learn to drive a car through ~20 hours of practice
 - complete a PhD thesis after ~5 years of work
 - do all the tasks of a computer programmer (or any other knowledge worker)

### Responsible AI

**Dimensions**:
 - fairness: ensuring ai does not perpetuate or amplify biases
 - transparency: Making AI systems and their decisions understandable to stakeholders impacted
 - privacy: Protecting user data and ensure confidentiality
 - security: Safeguard AI systems from malicious attacks
 - ethical use: Ensuring AI is used for beneficial purposes

**Tips**:
 -  Build a culture that encourages discussion and debate on ethical issues 
 - Brainstorm how things can go wrong 
   - E.g., Could there be issues with fairness, transparency, privacy, security, ethical use? 
 - Work with a diverse team and include perspectives from all stakeholders
