These days, there is an ongoing debate between people about **television** and if it should be viewed as a positive or 
negative impact on society.While it is possible to claim that **television** provides a good source of entertainment for people, my view is that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. In this essay, I shall explain my point of view 
by analysing both sides of the argument.

There are several reasons why **television** is  considered to be disadvantageous to society. One of them is that 
**viewing televisions** can be a source of distraction in our lives, turning away our focus from the more important 
things in life. It can also be argued that we tend to waste hours **in front of the television** instead of working on 
our goals and ambitions in life. For example, children at a young age spending too much time **in front of the television**, are missing out on opportunities for all-around development.

Those who argue for television have a different view and say that it can actually be a good thing. Firstly, it is 
claimed that television can be a good source of information to learn new things if used correctly. Then, there are 
concerns about people not viewing television to be unaware of current events and the latest news around the world.

In conclusion, while there are strong arguments on both sides of the case, my personal opinion is that **television 
usage** is best avoided or minimised as we should focus on other productive tasks instead.
